                    alt="Mardi_Gras_Parade,_New_Orleans,_Louisiana_(LOC)">
                The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New
                Orleans.
                Celebrations
                are
                concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
                start
                of
                lent in
                the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season actually begins
                on
                King's
                Day
                (12th Night), January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls start
                soon
                after,
                though most are extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old families and
                their
                courts
                consisting of the season's debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As Fat
                Tuesday
                gets
                nearer,
                the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
                have
                several
                large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras
                season. In
                the
                final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
                balls
                (some of
                them masquerade balls).
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule
                and route
                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                Knights
                of
                Momus and
                the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
                (often
                featuring
                celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
                Pleasure Club—a
                predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
                common
                throws are
                strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", and small inexpensive
                toys.
                Major
                krewes
                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

            <p class="text">

                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
                in
                the
                Uptown and
                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
                the
                French
                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and 'tit Rex - also take place downtown in
                the
                Faubourg
                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally
                concludes
                with
                the
                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

            <h3>Epiphany</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Epiphany on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since at
                least
                1900;
                locally,
                it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve, January 5,
                the
                evening of the
                twelfth day of Christmastide. The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans' second-oldest Krewe, have staged
                a
                parade
                and
                masked ball on this date since 1870. A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows, La
                Société
                Pas
                Si
                Secrète Des Champs-Élysées and the Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc have more recently begun to stage events on
                Epiphany as
                well.

                Many of Carnival's oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers' Society, hold masked balls but no
                longer
                parade
                in public.

                Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday.

            <h3>Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day</h3>
            <p class="text">

                A 2020 study estimated that Mardi Gras brings 1.4 million visitors to New Orleans.

                Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the newest all-female
                Krewe.
                Nyx
                is
                famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe status since their founding in
                2011.

                Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade is
                relatively
                new,
                but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly
                sought-after
                decorated
                shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities.

                Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'État parades, ending
                with
                one of
                the
                fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus.[45] There are several smaller neighborhood parades like
                the
                Krewe
                of
                Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.

                Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis) and on Sunday
                (Thoth,
                Okeanos, and
                Krewe of Mid-City).

                The first of the "super krewes," Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led Bacchus
                parade
                on
                Sunday
                night.

                    alt="Mardi Gras Day 2019 in New Orleans-On Royal Street, French Quarter 50">
                The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and
                March 9
                (depending
                on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).

                In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and
                ending
                at Broad
                and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from
                Napoleon
                to St.
                Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud
                horns,
                with entire
                families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller
                parades
                and
                walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish
                Channel
                Corner
                Club,
                Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way
                to
                the
                French
                Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne
                journeys
                from
                the
                Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers
                rambles
                from bar to
                bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided
                into
                uptown and
                downtown tribes, parade in their finery.

                    alt="LaToya Cantrell">
                Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                history. Once
                in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic
                plan to address
                families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
                finding solutions to
                violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use,
                Cantrell has
                focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public
                parks, and green
                spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four
                opioid
                manufacturers and distributors.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with
                Governor John
                Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding
                for the city's
                infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city.[32] Following the
                approval of the
                Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council put
                on the ballot
                in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
                properties, as
                well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.

            <h3>Early history</h3>
            <p>
                The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River
                in
                what is now
                lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it
                as
                part of an
                observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
                unknown. A 1730
                account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
                cross-dressing).
                An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing
                of
                masks in the
                streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                whenever
                such
                restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money
                to
                fund an
                official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other
                Miscellaneous
                Pieces
                describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835:

                and comic
                masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys,
                women and
                girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in
                grotesque,
                quizzical,
                diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds,
                beasts and birds
                with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from
                the
                moon;
                mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts,
                coaches, cars,
                &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling,
                fifeing, and
                all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

            <p>
                In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe Mardi Gras
                with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus.
                According to one
                historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered
                a
                French
                festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had
                passed from
                French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and
                its
                Creoles. To a
                certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of
                how
                their business
                prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized
                Carnival
                passed from
                Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century.
                The
                spectacle of
                Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms
                and
                on the
                streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                American."
            </p>
            <p>

                In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[5] War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions
                sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War,
                World
                War I and
                World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.
            </p>
            <p>

                The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co. The
                rumored but
                long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one
                transporting a
                live ox. In December of 2022, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically
                significant"
                by the
                National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

                In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved
                to
                surrounding
                communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the
                city.
                Masking,
                costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen
                prevented crimes
                against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for
                these
                reasons, some
                in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.
            </p>
            <p>

                In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
                Mardi Gras
                Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or
                sexual
                orientation,
                to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.[9] Shortly after the law was passed, the city
                demanded
                that these
                krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the
                distinctly
                private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction
                to
                demand
                otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading.[10] Proteus
                did
                parade in
                the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in
                2000.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                federal
                courts later
                declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
                association, and an
                unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance.[11] The US Supreme Court
                refused to hear
                the city's appeal from this decision.

                Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                dues,
                and any member
                can have a place on a parade float.

            <h3>Effects of Hurricane Katrina</h3>
            <p>
                The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a few people to question the
                future of
                the city's
                Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried to play this
                sentiment
                for
                electoral advantage. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's
                revival.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="pImageRight" src="./images/About/220px-ChaosCheifEngineer100Hades4.jpg"
                    alt="ChaosCheifEngineer100Hades">

                The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back celebration
                to
                limit strains
                on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so
                negotiations
                between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less
                severely than
                originally suggested.

                2006: A Knights of Chaos float satirizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, responsible for the failed
                levees
                in New
                Orleans
                The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through
                Marigny
                and the
                French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were several parades
                on
                Saturday,
                February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades followed daily from Thursday night
                through Mardi
                Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades going through Algiers, all New Orleans parades
                were
                restricted
                to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped
                significant
                flooding. Some
                krewes unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood
                damage
                suffered by
                that neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>

                The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late at night they could end.
                National
                Guard troops
                assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State troopers also assisted, as
                they
                have many
                times in the past. Many floats had been partially submerged in floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes
                repaired and
                removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs
                of
                the floats.
            </p>
            <p>

                Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly affected by the storm's
                aftermath. Many
                had lost most or all of their possessions, but enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense as an
                affirmation of life.
                The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials
                and
                tribulations
                of living in the devastated city. References included MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers,
                along
                with much
                mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national politicians.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to the Mid-City route, and other Krewes expanding
                their
                parades
                Uptown.
            </p>
            <h3>2020 tandem float incidents</h3>
            <p>
                In 2020, two parade attendees—one during the Nyx parade, and one during the Endymion parade, were killed
                after being
                struck and run over in between interconnected "tandem floats" towed by a single vehicle. Following the
                incident during
                the Nyx parade, there were calls for New Orleans officials to address safety issues with these floats
                (including
                outright bans, or requiring the gaps to be filled in using a barrier). Following the second death during
                the
                Endymion
                parade on February 22, 2020 (which caused the parade to be halted and cancelled), city officials
                announced
                that tandem
                floats would be banned effective immediately, with vehicles restricted to one, single float only.

                        Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn
                        themselves with long beads caught
                        from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with their
                        families are everywhere, and
                        both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit on the ground, throw balls,
                        play music, eat great
                        food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. <br>
